# zipBackup
 
This was created for a customer that had a few repeated issues with their access database backup.
The idea here is to remind the user to close the access database, then zip it with timestamp and place it on the desktop and a local backup folder.
It zips twice because the file is smaller, it might be improved by zipping once and copying the result in two places.
